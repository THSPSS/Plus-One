# Write your MySQL query statement below
# My solution
select event_day as day , emp_id  , sum(out_time-in_time) as total_time
from Employees
group by day , emp_id

=================================================================
# query comparison
# sum(out_time-in_itme) is slightly faster
Query A:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select
    event_day as day, emp_id
    , sum(out_time) - sum(in_time) as total_time
from
    Employees
group by
    event_day, emp_id
Query B:

select
    event_day as day, emp_id
    , sum(out_time-in_time) as total_time
from
    Employees
group by
    event_day, emp_id
