This is a FB DE interview question in 2019H2 - 2020H1.
There are 4 SQL questions in 30 minute,this one is the first and easiest for warming up.
But in the real interview, the description is harder than LC.


The original question is :

Write a query to get the percentage of certain products

SELECT ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN low_fats = 'Y' OR recyclable = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),2) AS  PERCENTAGE




# Write your MySQL query statement below
select product_id
from Products
where low_fats ='Y' and recyclable = 'Y'
