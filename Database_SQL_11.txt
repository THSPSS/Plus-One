## my solution. but it is really burte
SELECT distinct CART_ID
FROM CART_PRODUCTS
WHERE CART_ID IN (select cart_id
                 from CART_PRODUCTS
                 where name ='Milk')
                 and
                 CART_ID in (select cart_id
                 from CART_PRODUCTS
                 where name ='Yogurt')

## other solution
SELECT CART_ID
FROM CART_PRODUCTS
WHERE NAME = 'Milk' AND CART_ID IN (
    SELECT CART_ID
    FROM CART_PRODUCTS
    WHERE NAME = 'Yogurt'
)
ORDER BY CART_ID;

## solution with oracle
## using group by and having
select cart_id
from cart_products
group by cart_id
having sum(case when name = 'Milk' then 1 else 0 end) > 0
   and sum(case when name = 'Yogurt' then 1 else 0 end) > 0
order by cart_id


## in and distict
SELECT CART_ID
FROM CART_PRODUCTS
WHERE NAME IN ('Milk', 'Yogurt')
GROUP BY CART_ID
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT(NAME)) >= 2
ORDER BY CART_ID
