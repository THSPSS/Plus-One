#Write an SQL query to rank the scores. The ranking should be calculated
#according to the following rules:

#The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
#If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
#After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.
#Return the result table ordered by score in descending order.

#The query result format is in the following example.


# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT score, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS 'rank'
FROM Scores;



SELECT S.Score, COUNT(S2.Score) AS Rank FROM Scores S,
(SELECT DISTINCT Score FROM Scores) S2
WHERE S.Score<=S2.Score
GROUP BY S.Id
ORDER BY S.Score DESC;




SELECT Score, convert(Rank,SIGNED) AS Rank FROM
    (SELECT Score, @rank:=CASE WHEN Score=@previous THEN @rank ELSE @rank+1 END AS Rank, @previous:=Score FROM Scores,
        (SELECT @previous:=-1,@rank:=0) AS initial
    ORDER BY Score DESC) A;
