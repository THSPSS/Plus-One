# Write your MySQL query statement below
# SELECT name AS 'customers'
# FROM Customers c
# LEFT JOIN Orders o
# ON o.customerId = c.id
# WHERE o.customerId IS NULL;

#using Subquery
SELECT name AS 'Customers' FROM Customers c
WHERE c.id NOT IN (SELECT o.customerId FROM Orders o)


#other solution
select name as Customers from Customers AS c
WHERE c.id NOT IN (select Orders.customerID from Orders)
